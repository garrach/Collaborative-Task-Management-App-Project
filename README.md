# Collaborative Task Management App Project

## Project Overview

Hey everyone! Exciting times â€“ I'm working on my Projet de Fin d'Ã‰tude (PFE), and this one is all about building a Collaborative Task Management App using React.js and Firebase. ðŸš€

## Features

### React.js Frontend

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Creating a clean and intuitive UI for users to manage their tasks.

2. **Task Listing:**
   - Displaying tasks with details like title, description, and due date.

3. **Task Creation and Editing:**
   - Allowing users to create new tasks and edit existing ones on the fly.

4. **Collaborative Real-time Editing:**
   - Implementing real-time collaboration features so multiple users can edit tasks simultaneously. This is the cool part!

### Firebase Backend

5. **Authentication:**
   - Integrating Firebase authentication for secure user sign-up and login.

6. **Real-time Database:**
   - Using Firebase's real-time database to sync tasks in real-time among all users.

7. **Cloud Functions:**
   - Implementing cloud functions for automated tasks, like sending notifications.

### Additional Features

8. **Task Filtering:**
   - Allowing users to filter tasks based on various criteria â€“ status, due date, etc.

9. **Notifications:**
   - Sending push notifications for task updates or approaching due dates.

10. **User Profiles:**
    - Creating user profiles where users can customize their preferences and view their task history.
